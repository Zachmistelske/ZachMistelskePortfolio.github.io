The project consists of plots that illustrates the trend in these variables over the course of 3 years with a forecast predicting the likelihood of the future trend into 2.5 years and statistics geographically portraying information such as death rates and positivity rates. Below are the syntaxes for finding the world average death rate from covid-19, and the SQL files for calculations and further analysis.</p>

                                    <p>The premise of this analysis is to observe trends in deaths and cases then compare them to the trends observed in vaccinations, tests, etc... to identify the patterns to observe if Covid-19 really is being controlled. According to the Total Vaccinations Graphic, it is apparent that the total reported deaths by month are rising much slower than the total number of vaccinations, and began to decrease in May 2022. According to the forecast, deaths should cease between January and February of 2023 while tests continue to increase and cases ceasing between April and May of 2023. Although, patients will still need Icu and Hospitalizations. The average death rate due to Covid-19 in the entire world was found to be at 3.98%. The U.S. was found to be the most prominent country for the highest amount of deaths and cases, but with a death percentage of 1.17%. This is most likely due to international travel, and the U.S. having the best availability for hospitilization where the average number of patients in ICU and hospitals is higher than all reported countries. Below are Tableau interactives that displays more information.</p>

                                    <p>Also, upon observation of the Vaccinations and Health Statistics graphic, Japan and countries in Europe have higher percentages of the population being older than 65 and positivity rates, but have lower death percentages below 1%. Russia, U.S., Europe, South Africa, Japan, and Malaysia have the highest reported percentages of smokers. South Africa, Bulgaria, and Bolivia have the highest death percentages higher than 2%. Thus, smoking could have an effect on Covid-19 related deaths as seen in South Africa. However, Most countries reported have high percentages of people fully vaccinated, especially in the countries where the death percentage is lower than 2% which indicates how important it is to have the majority of the population vaccinated. So, In conclusion, forecasting indicates that Covid-19 should cease in the following year of 2023 as long as vaccinations and tests continue to persist. Below is a power point presentation that summarizes findings.</p>

                            <h2>Observing Global Energy Consumption</h2>
                            <p>As the demand for energy increases in the world with rising populations, it is important to observe trends in how much energy is being consumed by multiple sources. In this project, we will observe what types of energy sources are the most prominent in consumption per capita (kWh), which ones behave linearly such that predictions can be made, and if the use of fossil fuels is decreasing.</p>

                                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                                    <p>By looking at multiple data sets for energy consumption by coal, oil, solar, wind, hydro, nuclear per capita (kWh) from the energy explorer on OurWorldInData.org, we will begin first by taking a look into which how much energy consumption is persisting overtime for each sources. Then find how much they contribute to the total world energy consumption for each source. Below is the cleaned excel file that shows the average and total energy consumption in kWh for each country, the percentages for each source, and how much each source is contributing to the respective countries.</p>

                                    <p>Based off of calculations, coal contibutes 23.7%, hydro at 35.1%, nuclear at 11.6%, oil at 29.0%, solar at 0.48%, and wind at 0.17% of energy consumed per capita in the world. This implies that fossil fuels such as coal and oil consists of just over half of the world's energy consumption per capita. The U.S. and Australia has the highest in coal percentage contributions in the world at 1.47% and 1.93% respectively. Below is the SQL query used to find the total and average energy consumption per capita for each country and to identify any linear trends in each of the six energy sources contributing to the world by average and uncertainty.</p>

                                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                                    <p>According to the forecasting, fossil fuel consumption such as coal and oil consumption is expected to decrease by the year 2030 where coal consumption is expected to reach the amount as the same as near 1989 and oil consumption as the same as near 1999. There is also an apparent linear trend in solar and wind energy consumption from the year 2011 to 2021. The energy source that experienced the largest change in percentage difference in world consumption was solar energy at 2,282.49% from 1988 to 1989. Energy sources such as coal, oil, and hydro all have experienced noticable decreases in percentage differences from 2020 to 2021 between 20%-90% further indicating that they are on the decline. By the year, the average energy consumption of solar and wind consumption is expected to be 135.8 kWh and 251.9 kWh respectively from the forecast from 2011 to 2021. Thus, fossil fules will be less relied on in the future, which are also the most prominent along with hydro, and the average energy consumption of solar and wind energy sources indeed behave somewhat linearly in time from 2011 to 2021.

                            <p>As demands for more energy increase in today's world, numerous evidence suggests a direct parallel to global warming to CO2 emissions for fuel and energy. In this project, we take a look at MtCO2e (metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent) in the world by country and year.

                                    <p>The first observation to make, is what top 10 countries are contributing with emissions and how are the emissions behaving overtime. It was found that China, United States, India, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, and the United Kingdom are the highest contributers with China having the highest records since 2005. Below is the SQL file used to calculate the averages and total of emmisions by country and their percentage contributions, and the average emissions of the world by year and the uncertainty.</p>

                                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                                    <p>The forecasting predicts an increase in all emissions by these countries up to the year 2029 where the highest as by China will be predicted at 13,927 MtCO2e. Looking from the year 1990 to 2019 for the combined emissions from these countries, the emissions experience a sparatic behavior by each year in emissions, with the highest at 8.5% difference between 1996 and 1998. The total percentage yearly differences are increasing by year, averaging around 2%. China and the United States are the largest contributors of MtCO2e emissions at 212,227 and 177,781 MtCO2e respectively, which has a percentage contribution of 18.52% and 15.25% also repectiveley which makes up for just slightly more than the third of all global MtCO2e emissions. Now, looking at the average MtCO2e emissions in the world by year, it is apparent that there is a linear relationship in emissions in time, where an increase is in both variables predicting an average of 277.4 MtCO2e emissions by the year 2029. Thus, we certainly see a similar trend of MtCO2e emissions with climate change. Below are the Tableau stories with interactive visualizations displaying more information.</p>

Thus, Linear-fit regression of the form y=a+bx was performed finding a good fitting model of y = 1945.2(9.4) + 0.297(0.049)x. Uncertainties marked with () and x is the average emissions with y being time in years. So, for emissions of 277.4 MtCO2e for the tableau graph in 2029, it was found that the year is 2027(23) which is up to percision of nearly 1.13% furhter implying the model agrees with the tableau forecasting.</p>

                                    <h2>Solar Energy Linear Fit</h2>
                                    <p>Looking back on the energy consumption project, it is apparent that the average solar energy per capita for all countries behaves linearly from 2011 to 2021. Thus, Linear fit regression of the form y = a + bx can be used for predictions of the year based on solar energy consumption per capita (kWh). The regression yeilded y = 2010.5(2.8) + 0.117(0.093)x. By plugging in the energy consumption per capita of 135.6 kWh in the year 2023 from the tableau forcast, yielded 2026(16) which is up to percision of nearly 0.8% furhter implying the model is in close agreement.</p>

                                    <p>Similar concept as the solar energy consumption per capita regression, wind was found to be modeled by y = 2001.1(2.8) + 0.118(0.083)x. Thus, By plugging in the energy consumption per capita of 251.9 kWh in the year 2023 from the tableau forcast, yielded 2030(24) which could be more accurate if the solar energy consumption in the last year 2021 of the data was ignored. </p>
